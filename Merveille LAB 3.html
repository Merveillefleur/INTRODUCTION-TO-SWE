<body>
   <p> A software should be developed for Siantou students to be identified efficiently using a small amount of time to enable students to go in class in time(no croud) and assure security.Classes begins at 7:30am but the identification check-out is done by teachers who do not check properly and take a lot of time.For a student who comes to school at 7:25am will end up moving to classe at 7:35am and may end up not attending the classe for the punctual teachers.And the inefficient of the teachers due to rapide controle done sometimes,we give way to intrudes leading to the insecurity of the students.A machine should be elaborated at every entrance of the campus with all the information of students(matriculation number,name,course) and finger prints,this will encourage security and
    the punctuality of the students.<p>
